# MOXI : AN EXPERIMENT IN PLAY

## MOXI

MOXI is an light api and/or wrapper around [PIXIJS](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html) objects that with interfaces that create a surface area to create behaviors, plugins and and event signals.  


## MOXI-EDIT : THE SPIKE PHASE

MOXI-EDIT is an experiment to play with browser based sandboxes while builing an extensible stage editor around PIXI containers. 

The Stage Editor should be simple but extensible and would have a built in code editor environemnt for JavaScript and TypeScript based behaviors and games. 

no written mvp, no docs yet, it's very fluid 

[There is a demo of the basic real-time code editor here](https://ineffably.github.io/moxi/packages/moxi-edit/)
